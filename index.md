# Namaste!

I am the founder of [Yarsa Labs](https://www.yarsalabs.com).

I am a software engineer currently based in Pokhara, living at my own home with my family. I have two great dogs named Ruby and Swift, and I like to read about technology. I follow the latest news in the field of software, startups, and Nepalese politics.

I founded Yarsa Labs in 2016, and have been providing opportunities to fresh graduates in Pokhara ever since. I mostly write code, manage people, and make sure everything is in place. Located in Pokhara and Kathmandu, my startup employs some really nice people.
