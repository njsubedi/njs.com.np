Your, product, service, or website has zero customers on the launch day. You wait until the end of the day, and the end
of the week. People don't seem interested in what you are offering. You have heard about people who had several hundred
sales in the first week; they reached the height of success in their first shot. Here you are, still wondering why
nobody is paying you for the project that seems like a brilliant idea. You anticipated this one would bring you a
fortune. Well, not this time.

Startups are easy to start and hardly ever become successful. Most of the startups fail to continue as a business after
existing for a short period. For a founder, being successful in growing a startup into a sustainable business is the
ultimate goal. Failure is when you realize it is not worth investing your energy, time, and money on that venture
anymore. That situation could arise when you need to keep working hard to keep the ship afloat, or the business is
losing more money than it is making despite any effort. It is usual for a startup to lose money while the product is
still under development, but after the product is launched, marketed and people have started to use your product, you
should expect to see some paying customers.

How sure are you about its success, and why? You are always unsure about it. But yeah, that's what happens in
every startup. Neither of those fortunate multi billion dollar companies had a clear view of today. They started small;
they stayed small. They were not different. They succeeded not because they needed success and struggled for it. It is
because the world needed them; the market needed their products. They had built something that people urgently needed
for solving their problem. Though very small niche of customers, they had permabent ones.

Gradually the niche spread out, and their garage startup turned out to be multi billion dollar company.

What about you? Have you ever thought of a startup idea that would solve real world problems? Or you are just working on
a *brilliant* idea that came into your mind while you were taking a dump at a friend's house last weekend? That doesn't
even matter!

Find a market, not an idea.  Good luck with your new startup. Stay updated, stay smart.
