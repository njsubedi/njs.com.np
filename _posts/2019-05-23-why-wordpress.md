Because why not. Running a blog on a shared hosting already has some limitations. But it took me less than 5 minutes to set this up using the built-in installer. I added one single CNAME record and a couple of lines in the default .htaccess file. I'm happy that everything is set up.

* Redirected from www to non-www site? — check;
* Forced redirect to https? — check;
* Neat URL? — check.

I didn't have to deal with a dependency hell like with other self-hosted JS based CMSes. I didn't have to worry about the blogging platform closing my account for writing what they don't like. I didn't have to maintain a repository, and write git commit and git push every time I made a change. I don't have to see how many pounds I added to write a ####heading. I can open up a page, and use the in-line Edit option to make changes on the fly. WordPress was built primarily for blogs, and I am surprised how wonderfully it works out of the box.

> But what about these super cool stuff like fault-tolerant, asynchronous, event-driven, non-blocking I/O, distributed, dockerized, redundant servers, edge caching, one-click publishing, static site generator, xyz pages, custom domain … ?

Well, I have my own domain and own hosting. WordPress itself has been around for ages, and battle-tested. That's enough for a personal blog. What I write should matter the most; not how and where it is served from.
